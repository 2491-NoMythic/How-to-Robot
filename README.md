# How-to-Robot
This is the NoMythic wiki, including syntax, sample code, other FRC-related things, and random anecdotes from past programmers.
Anecdotes written with as many words as possible and sarcasm were written by [REDACTED].
Anecdotes that make little to no sense written by Yours Truly™.
We make no promises about the tone of the other contributors. Most of the time, anecdotes and tips are signed anyway.
The main text in a professional tone could be written by anyone.
